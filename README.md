A Rest application that allows you to create users, upload images, and then have users add captions to these users (MEMES). The captions can then be voted up or down. 
It's just an application made for fun. It shows request objects and models and converters that allow you to validate the data being entered. It also contains examples
of tests using mock objects rather than real infrastructure.
